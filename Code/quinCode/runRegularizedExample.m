%% =========== Regularized Logistic Regression ============
%  In this part, you are given a dataset with data points that are not
%  linearly separable. However, you would still like to use logistic 
%  regression to classify the data points. 
%
%  To do so, you introduce more features to use -- in particular, you add
%  polynomial features to our data matrix (similar to polynomial
%  regression).
%

% Add Polynomial Features

% Note that mapFeature also adds a column of ones for us, so the intercept
% term is handled
X = mapFeature(X(:,1), X(:,2));

% Initialize fitting parameters
initial_theta = zeros(size(X, 2), 1);

% Set regularization parameter lambda to 1
lambda = 1;

% Compute and display initial cost and gradient for regularized logistic
% regression
[cost, grad] = costFunctionReg(initial_theta, X, y, lambda);

fprintf('Cost at initial theta (zeros): %f\n', cost);

fprintf('\nProgram paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
pause;

%% ============= Regularization and Accuracies =============
%  In this part, you will get to try different values of lambda and 
%  see how regularization affects the decision coundart
%
%  Try the following values of lambda (0, 1, 10, 100).
%
%  NOTE: With a small lambda, you should notice that the classifier
%  gets almost every training example correct, but draws a very complicated
%  boundar, thus overfitting the data. However, with a larger lambda
%  you should see a plot that shows an simpler decision boundary
%  which still separates the positives and negatives fairly well. However,
%  make sure not to set lambda too high because then the decision 
%  boundary will underfit the data.

% Initialize fitting parameters
initial_theta = zeros(size(X, 2), 1);

% Set regularization parameter lambda to 1 (you should vary this)
lambda = 1;

% Set Options
options = optimset('GradObj', 'on', 'MaxIter', 400);

% Optimize
[theta, J, exit_flag] = ...
	fminunc(@(t)(costFunctionReg(t, X, y, lambda)), initial_theta, options);

% Plot Boundary
plotDecisionBoundary(theta, X, y);
hold on;

% Compute accuracy on our training set
